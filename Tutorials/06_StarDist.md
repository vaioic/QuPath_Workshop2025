# Using StarDist in QuPath
[StarDist](https://github.com/stardist), created by Uwe Schmidt and Martin Weigert, is a deep learning convolution neural net that excels at detecting round blob objects, like nuclei. It is also excellent at detecting these types of shapes when they are highly clustered.

Two primary models have been created and released by Schmidt and Weigert, and are available to use with QuPath's StarDist extension: dsb2018_paper(_heavy_augment) for fluorescence data and he_heavy_augment for H&E stained tissues. 

## Setup for using StarDist
You should have already installed the StarDist extension ([instructions](/Tutorials/Setup_extenstions.md))

You will also need the StarDist models located [here](/Tutorials/StarDist_Models/). I recommend saving them in the QuPath_Extension folder in a new child folder (e.g., QuPath_Extensions/StarDist_models) so it is easier to keep track of them.

After installing the extension and downloading the models, go to Extensions > StarDist. You will see four script options that are pre-written to run on the datatype specified.

We will test out the fluorescence and H&E models.

## Running StarDist
StarDist is run through a script. There are a few parameters available in the script to fine tune the results of the model.

- `channels('name' or index of channel)` The channel that contains blob like objects. If using index value, indexing starts a 0. *Only applies to fluorescence-like images.*
- `threshold(value between 0-1)` The higher the value the more stringent the results.
- `pixelSize(any floating point value)` Minimum value is the pixel size of the image. Increasing the number will down sample the image prior to running StarDist, the more down sampling the less accurate the outlines.
- `normalizePercentiles(lower, upper)` Default is `1,99` which works well for most data. Increase the lower value to cut out background and decrease the upper value if the signals are very dim. 

The location of the model also needs to be provided in the variable `modelPath`.

Example of a model path = `'/path/to/location/dsb2018_paper.pb'`

Optional `cellExpansion(number in um)` can be used to create an arbitrary expansion of the specified distance around the detection.

If not already in your project, add the kidney_3chan.czi (fluorescence) and 44770.svs (H&E) images.

### Fluorescence model
Open the kidney_3chan.czi image and create a 2048x2048 rectangle using Objects > Annotations > Specify annotation

<img src='/Tutorials/PNGs/SpecifyAnnotation.png' width='279' height='272'><br>
<img src='/Tutorials/PNGs/SpecifyAnnotation2.png' width='150' height='161'><br>

Move the rectangle to somewhere you find interesting in the image. Then open `StarDist fluorescence cell detection script` under Extensions > StarDist

Change `pixelSize` to `0.345` and enter the path to the location of the dsb2018_paper.pb model in the `modelPath` variable.

Select the rectangle (should be highlighted) and then press `Run` to run StarDist. It should take approximately 1 min to run on the Short Partition.

Try changing some of the parameters to see how they influence the results.

*Tip: If you are using a script to batch analyze your data, find the parameters that generally work well on your data and then save the script in the QuPath project for documentation and future use.*

### H&E model
Open 44770.svs to test out the H&E model. Create a 2048X2048 rectangle and place it somewhere interesting. Then open `StarDist H&E nucleus detection script`. Like with using `StarDist fluorescence cell detection script`, you will need to add in the path to the `he_heavy_augment.pb` model. Because this model was trained on RGB images of H&E stained samples, you do not need to specify a channel. You can still adjust the `normalizePercentiles`, `threshold`, and `pixelSize` parameters to fine tune the results. 

Use `0.345` for the `pixelSize` and run the script.

Try out different parameters to see how they influence the results.

### Common Errors
```
ERROR: No parent objects are selected!
```
This means that the annotation is not selected, double click on the annotation in the image or select it in the Annotation tab and run the script again.

```
ERROR: I couldn't find the model file /typo/or/wrong/path/heheavy_augment.pb in QuPathScript at line number 25
```
Check the path or the slash type used. Groovy (the scripting language for QuPath) does not recognize `\` for paths, use either `\\` or `/`
